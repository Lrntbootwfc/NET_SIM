# NET_SIM — Network Topology Simulation and Analysis Tool

## Overview

**NET_SIM** (Network Simulation and Analysis Tool) is a modular CLI-based Python application designed to parse Cisco-like router configurations, build and validate network topologies, analyze bandwidth and network health, generate optimization recommendations, visualize network graphs, and simulate network scenarios such as link failures and day-to-day operations.

This tool aims to assist network engineers, researchers, and students in understanding and managing network topologies efficiently with automated analysis and visualization features.

---

## Features

- **Configuration Parsing:** Automatically parse router configuration files and link data.
- **Topology Building:** Construct a graph representation of the network devices and links.
- **Validation:** Detect and report configuration or topology inconsistencies and issues.
- **Network Analysis:** Provide detailed network statistics including bandwidth utilization, bottlenecks, and resiliency.
- **Optimization Suggestions:** Generate actionable recommendations to improve network performance.
- **Auto-Fix Suggestions:** Propose automated fixes based on identified issues.
- **Visualization:** Render network topology images with clear device and link mappings.
- **Simulation:** Simulate network events including device communication and link failures.
- **Interactive CLI:** User-friendly menu-driven command line interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lrntbootwfc/NET_SIM.git
cd NET_SIM
````

2. Set up and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration Files

* Place router configuration files (e.g., `R1.cfg`, `R2.cfg`, etc.) inside the `configs/` directory.
* Include a `links.txt` file in the `configs/` directory describing physical or logical links.
* Refer to the sample configuration files provided for proper formatting.

---

## Usage

Run the main CLI program:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the interactive menu prompts to:

* Parse configuration files
* Build network topology
* Validate topology and configurations
* Analyze network bandwidth and performance
* Generate optimization and autofix suggestions
* Visualize the network graph
* Simulate day-to-day operations or link failures
