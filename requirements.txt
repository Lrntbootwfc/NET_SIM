# Core functionality
networkx             # Network graph creation & analysis
matplotlib           # Visualization of topology
rich                 # Beautiful CLI tables, progress bars, colored logs
psutil               # System & network resource monitoring
pyyaml               # YAML config parsing
jsonschema           # Validate JSON/YAML config formats

# Simulation & testing
faker                # Generate fake IPs, hostnames, and loads
scapy                # Optional - simulate & craft network packets (needs admin privileges)
simpy                # Process-based discrete-event simulation
pytest               # Testing framework
pytest-mock          # For mocking objects during tests

# Performance & concurrency
aiofiles             # Async file handling
asyncio              # Built-in, but added for clarity in async features
uvloop               # Fast event loop replacement for asyncio
tqdm                 # Progress bars for long tasks

# Optional debugging & dev tools
black                # Code formatting
flake8               # Linting
